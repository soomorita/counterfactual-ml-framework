Conceptual framework for counterfactual machine learning — bridging causal inference, AI ethics, and applied economics.

# Counterfactual Machine Learning (Work in Progress)

This repository contains the **conceptual framework and prototype codebase** for my ongoing research on **counterfactual machine learning (CFML)** — bridging causal inference, AI ethics, and applied economics.

## Overview
The goal is to explore how *counterfactual reasoning* can enhance the interpretability and fairness of machine learning models used for policy evaluation and decision-making.

## Current Progress
- Literature review and theoretical framework construction  
- Prototyping causal estimation with simulated data in Python (PyTorch, EconML)  
- Experiment design for applied economic simulations  

## Planned Components
- Counterfactual data generation module  
- Policy evaluation estimator (DML, CEVAE)  
- Visualization dashboard (Streamlit)  

## Motivation
Understanding **“what would have happened if...”** scenarios is crucial in both public policy and AI-driven economic systems. This project aims to make those mechanisms transparent and testable.

## Future Directions
- Extend to agent-based market simulations  
- Integrate reinforcement learning for adaptive counterfactuals
